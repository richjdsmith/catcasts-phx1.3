# Tutorial for creating an Elixir Phoenix app
https://medium.brianemory.com/elixir-phoenix-creating-an-app-part-1-the-setup-6626264be03

## Updated using Phoenix 1.3
I have updated my Elixir Phoenix tutorial. It is upgraded to Phoenix 1.3, Elixir
1.5.1. I have fixed some grammar errors (like using "are" instead of "our"... ugh!)
and refactored the code.

Note: if you are referencing this repo from the tutorial, anywhere you see
`catcasts_phx13` or `catcasts_phx1_3` would be `catcasts` in the tutorial.

## The original version using Phoenix 1.2.1
